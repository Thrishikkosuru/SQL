# SQL
My Notes.
SQL stands for STructured Query Language.
SQL is a programming language used to communicate with our database
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer*                   
Gives the no of rows in the customer table.
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
